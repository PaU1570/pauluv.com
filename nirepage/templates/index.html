		<h1>You</h1>
		<p>Have stumbled upon my personal website. Do let me know if you like the design and color scheme.</p>
		<p>I'm Paul Uriarte, currently a student at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I started this website as a personal side project, intended as a sort of digital diary and tinkering playground. I don't really expect many people other than myself to use this website (how did you find it, anyway?), but if you do, welcome. My intention is to write about whatever I am thinking about, and see what comes out.</p>
		<p>If you are curious about the unicorn picture, it's a watercolor drawing I did back in 2017, which I often use as my profile picture. I copied the concept from some image I found on Google, so don't give me points for creativity. I do have some more stuff on my Instagram and the Gallery tab.</p>
		<p>Here are other places on the internet where you can find me:</p>
